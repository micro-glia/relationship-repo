## Technical Implementations

### 1. Decentralized Data Marketplace
**Description**: A decentralized marketplace where researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and institutions can securely buy and sell neuroscience data. This platform leverages blockchain to provide immutable data records and smart contracts to ensure compliance with terms and privacy agreements.

**Estimated Market Size**: $500M - $1B annually in the next five years.

**Contacts**: 
- Alice Doe (Blockchain Specialist)
- Bob Lee (Neuroscience Research Analyst)
- Charlie Yao (Web3 Security Engineer)

### 2. NFT-Based Research Access Passes
**Description**: Neuroscience data contributors mint NFTs as access passes, granting buyers exclusive rights to datasets or future research insights. This approach monetizes data ownership while maintaining contributor privacy through anonymized data storage.

**Estimated Market Size**: $100M annually.

**Contacts**: 
- Emma Clark (Smart Contracts Developer)
- David Jones (Data Ethics Expert)
- Fiona Li (Web3 Designer)
