    Hi Alice,

    I came across this article that I thought would interest you: [The carbon in our bodies probably left the galaxy and came back on cosmic 'conveyer belt'](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/01/250103150922.htm)
    Summary: Scientists recently discovered that the giant 'conveyer belt' currents that push star-forged material out of our galaxy and pull it back in can also transport carbon atoms. That means that a good deal of the carbon here on Earth, including the carbon in our bodies, likely left the galaxy at some point!

    Since you are an expert in AI Research, Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts. Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.

    Best regards,  
    [Your Name]
