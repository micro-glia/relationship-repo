    ## Follow-Up with Emma

    Hi Emma,

    I came across this article that I thought would interest you: [Advanced imaging uncovers hidden metastases in high-risk prostate cancer cases](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/01/250103124918.htm)
    Summary: A new study has found that many cases of high-risk nonmetastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer may be more advanced than previously thought.

    Since you are an expert in Web3 Strategies, Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts. Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.

    Best regards,  
    [Your Name]
