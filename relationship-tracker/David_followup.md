    ## Follow-Up with David

    Hi David,

    I came across this article that I thought would interest you: [Loneliness linked to higher risk of heart disease and stroke and susceptibility to infection](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/01/250103125029.htm)
    Summary: Interactions with friends and family may keep us healthy because they boost our immune system and reduce our risk of diseases such as heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, new research suggests. Researchers drew this conclusion after studying proteins from blood samples taken from over 42,000 adults recruited to the UK Biobank.

    Since you are an expert in Neuroscience, Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts. Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.

    Best regards,  
    [Your Name]
