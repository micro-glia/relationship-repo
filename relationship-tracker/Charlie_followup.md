    Hi Charlie,

    I came across this article that I thought would interest you: [New nanocrystal material a key step toward faster, more energy-efficient computing](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/01/250103125043.htm)
    Summary: Chemistry researchers have taken a key step toward next-generation optical computing and memory with the discovery of luminescent nanocrystals that can be quickly toggled from light to dark and back again.

    Since you are an expert in Healthcare Innovations, Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts. Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.

    Best regards,  
    [Your Name]
